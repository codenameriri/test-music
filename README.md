Testing Live Music Generation Using the RiriFramework

How to use
----------

Grain and BPM are determined by the averages of the last 4 values for focus/relax level and pulse, respectively.

Control the focus/relax level with the 'Q' and 'A' keys (up and down, respecitvely). The level changes in increments of 5. -100 is MAX_RELAX, +100 is MAX_FOCUS.

Control the pulse with the 'W' and 'S' keys (up and down, respectively). The level changes in increments of 5. There is no max or min, but keep it reasonable (above 50, below 80).
